# Final Assignment of the course "Applied Data Science Capstone"

### Introduction

Everyone needs a place to live. There are many types of buildings that give us as a roof over our heads. It can be a house, villa, or flat. Each person at some point in life has to choose whether to buy a house, and if so, which one. Most people also wonder why are they so expensive?
Regardless of motives of buying and selling real estate, both sides agree on a price. It is always good to know how much a house is worth, what is the expected transaction price. An accurate prediction on the house price is important to prospective homeowners, developers, investors, appraisers, tax assessors and other real estate market participants, such as, mortgage lenders and insurers. Furthermore, it may be even more important why is the price like that, what has an impact on it.
In this project I will try to build a predictive model for house prices. I will use standard set of variables characterizing each property (such as property size, condition or number of rooms). In addition I will try to include some location-related features that will be created with the use of Foursquare location data.

### Data Description

* Dataset used for this project has been found on Kaggle repository. It contains sale prices of houses located in King County, in the U.S state of Washington. Data includes houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015. In this dataset one can also find many variables that characterize each property (like for example: area, condition, number of rooms, location, etc.). Original dataset has above 20 000 of observations and 21 variables and is of a very good quality, as there were no missing values.
* In addition Forsquare API have been used to get the most common venues of given regions in King County.
